### Problems
1. how to train the model(the loss function)?
2. how to deal with passage ()

### Solutions
1. structure
    * use the common one (maybe we can change the answer layer or take more account of the category or ..)
    * change the structure (based on *generating answers*, rather than *extracting answers*)
